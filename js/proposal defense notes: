proposal defense notes:

prof proj and anal


mark-
nail down better concepts of questions-


stats

broad- risk of scattered?  too braod?

fuzz idea- might not hurt to to look for themes that i want to look at going in- 

rico:

statisticas
inferentail stats-
pvalues

raraly see pvalues
no signifignace testing in news

wondering if part of what trying to do is that suggest more shoudl be done0-


rigor- might want to think about applying tat righor to survey-

	scott-

	theoretical framework - 
	framing theory-
